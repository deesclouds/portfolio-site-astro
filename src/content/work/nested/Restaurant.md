### **How It's Made?**

Tech used: HTML, CSS, CSS Grid by utilizing (https://angrytools.com/css-grid/), Flexbox, placeholder images were used via VS Code extension from (https://lorem.space), icons used from (https://fontawesome.com), (https://logodust.com), and placeholder logo from (https://logoipsum.com/).

### **Optimizations**

I am still working on the responsiveness of this project and will need to refractor the CSS code to be clear. So far I've formatted the code by using Prettier for ease of reading.

### **Lessons Learned**

Got this idea from the 100Devs to build a restaurant template to help those struggling during the pandemic thrive and gain a larger audience by helping improve their web presence.
